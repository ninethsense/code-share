# Kafka integration for C# beginners
Read my blog on this sample project -https://blog.ninethsense.com/technology/code/kafka-integration-for-c-beginners/
## Summary
* First, we have established the infrastructure by deploying a lightweight, single-container Kafka broker using the apache/kafka image in KRaft mode

* Next, we developed a Producer program that acts as a data source; this program connects to the broker and continuously streams simulated sensor data into a specific channel called a "topic." 

* To complete the pipeline, we have created a Consumer program that subscribes to that same topic, efficiently polling for new messages and processing them the moment they arrive. 

* When we executed both programs simultaneously, we established a continuous data flow where messages generated by our Producer were instantly persisted by the Dockerized broker and delivered in real-time to the Consumer, demonstrating the core mechanics of event-driven architecture.
